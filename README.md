DJANGO-HTMX Solution OUT OF BAND RESPONSES - UPDATING OTHER CONTENT
To see in action the htmx oob mechanism,
I need 2 def and 2 different partial pages.
The Button is the object I choosed,
to swap in updated content to the DOM.
In this demo I haven't any model.
The button could be a table, the oob mechanism is the same.
